## Generating an SSL Certificate for Nestri Relay

This guide is for developers and advanced users who wish to self-host Nestri Relay. We strongly discourage this setup for general users due to its complexity, particularly when it comes to configuring SSL certificates correctly. Using a self-signed certificate can lead to issues with browser compatibility and security warnings, making it difficult to ensure a smooth experience.

For most users, we highly recommend using the Nestri-hosted Relay, which requires no manual setup and is ready to use out of the box.
## Generating an SSL Certificate (PEM Format, Valid for 10 Days)

If you still wish to proceed, here is a basic example of how to generate a self-signed SSL certificate in PEM format, valid for 10 days. This certificate will allow secure communication between your Nestri Node and your browser or client device.
1. Open a terminal on your Linux machine.
2. Run the following command to generate the certificate:
```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 10 -nodes


```
3. Follow the prompts to fill in details like your country, state, and organization. For a basic development environment, these can be filled with placeholders.
4. This will generate two files:
- ```key.pem``` – Your private key
- ```cert.pem``` – The self-signed certificate
