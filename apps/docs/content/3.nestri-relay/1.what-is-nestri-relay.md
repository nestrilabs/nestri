Nestri Relay is an essential component in the Nestri cloud-gaming ecosystem, responsible for transporting the video gameplay stream from your Nestri Node to the device youâ€™re playing on. It is built on the WebRTC protocol, designed for efficient and smooth video transmission, ensuring a low-latency gaming experience.

By default, your Nestri Node will connect to the Nestri-hosted Relay, which we manage and is available for all users. This is the simplest and most straightforward option, requiring no additional configuration on your end.
