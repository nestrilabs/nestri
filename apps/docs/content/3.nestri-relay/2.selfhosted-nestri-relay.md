## Should I Self-Host a Nestri Relay?

If you want to use and enjoy the simplicity of the Nestri ecosystem, then you should not set up the Nestri Relay locally. Our free BYOG (Bring Your Own GPU) plan includes free shared relay access, which we highly recommend for those who want to start playing quickly on their own hardware without additional setup.

However, if you prefer to install and manage the Nestri Relay yourself, there are some important considerations to keep in mind.

### Important Considerations for Self-Hosting Nestri Relay

1. WebRTC and Firewall Issues
  * WebRTC, by default, attempts to access your public IP even if both the relay and Nestri Node are on the same local network.
  * This behavior can cause firewalls to block traffic, as the connection may attempt to access itself, resulting in connection failures.
  * Unordered Third
2. Recommended Deployment Strategy
  * Instead of hosting the relay on your local network, we strongly recommend deploying the Nestri Relay on a VPS (Virtual Private Server) in the cloud.
  * Using a cloud-based VPS minimizes potential firewall conflicts and ensures a more stable connection between your Nestri Node and the relay.

If you're set on self-hosting despite the potential challenges, proceed with caution and ensure you have a proper understanding of firewall configurations and networking setups to mitigate connectivity issues.

## Self-hosted Nestri Relay

For those who prefer full control over the Nestri stack, it is possible to self-host the Nestri Relay. However, setting this up can be a bit complex, as it requires SSL Certificates for secure communication between your Nestri Node and your gaming devices. There are three main options:

- **Let's Encrypt Certificate**: This is the most common certificates for self-hosting and requires a domain name. You can generate a certificate using tools like **certbot** or **acme.sh**. Let's Encrypt provides free SSL certificates that are trusted by most browsers and are relatively straightforward to set up.

- **Purchased SSL Certificate**: The **easiest option** for most users is to buy an SSL certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). This option eliminates much of the hassle involved with certificate generation and renewals, as these certificates are already trusted by browsers and donâ€™t require as much manual setup.

While self-hosting offers more flexibility, most users will find the **Nestri-hosted Relay** to be the easiest and most reliable option for getting started with cloud gaming on Nestri. This hosted relay is available to everyone using the BYOG package and requires no configuration.


## Prerequisites

1. **Server Requirements:**
   - Ensure **port 443** is open for both **TCP and UDP** (`:443/udp & :443/tcp`).
   - The server should have at least **6-8GB RAM** and **2 vCPUs**.
   - Supports both ARM or AMD64 architecture.

2. **Software Requirements:**
   - Docker and `docker-compose` must be installed on the server. You can use [this installation script](https://github.com/docker/docker-install) to set up Docker.
   - Git must be installed to clone the necessary repository.

3. **Certificates:**
   - You will need both private and public SSL certificates. It is recommended to use certificates from a **trusted Certificate Authority** (CA), either by using **Let's Encrypt** or purchasing a commercial SSL certificate, for secure communication. Avoid using self-signed certificates, as they can lead to compatibility issues and security warnings in browsers.
