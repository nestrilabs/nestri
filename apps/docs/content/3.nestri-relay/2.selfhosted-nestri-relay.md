# Self-hosted Nestri Relay

For those who prefer full control over their infrastructure, it is also possible to self-host the Nestri Relay. However, setting this up can be a bit complex, as it requires generating SSL certificates for secure communication between your Nestri Node and your gaming devices. There are two main options:

- Let's Encrypt Certificate: This is the recommended option for self-hosting and requires a domain name. You can generate a certificate using tools like acme.sh or certbot.

- Self-signed Certificate: If you donâ€™t have a domain name, you can generate a self-signed certificate. However, this approach is only recommended for advanced users due to potential security concerns and added complexity.

While self-hosting offers more flexibility, most users will find the Nestri-hosted Relay to be the easiest and most reliable option for getting started with cloud gaming on Nestri.


## Prerequisites

1. **Server Requirements:**
   - Ensure port 443 is open for both TCP and UDP (`:443/udp & :443/tcp`).
   - The server should have a minimum of **4GB RAM** and **2 vCPUs**.
   - Supports ARM or AMD64 architecture.

2. **Software Requirements:**
   - Docker and `docker-compose` must be installed on the server. You can use [this installation script](https://github.com/docker/docker-install) for Docker.
   - Git must be installed to clone the necessary repository.

3. **Certificates:**
   - You will need private and public certificates. It is recommended to use certificates from a trusted CA rather than self-signed certificates.
