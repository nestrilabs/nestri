# What is Nestri?

Nestri is a self-hosted cloud-gaming solution that allows you to stream and play your own games remotely from any device with a browser. Similar to services like NVIDIA GeForce Now, Nestri lets you enjoy high-performance gaming without being physically tied to your gaming PC. The key difference is that Nestri is entirely self-hosted, meaning you have complete control over the server, the games you install, and the overall setup.

Nestri is designed for gamers who value privacy, flexibility, and control, making it the ideal choice for those who prefer to manage their own infrastructure rather than rely on third-party services. You can play your games from virtually anywhere, as long as you have access to a web browser and a stable internet connection.
## Nestri Modules

To provide a smooth and efficient gaming experience, Nestri is composed of the following key components:

### Nestri Node
The Nestri Node is the core of your Nestri setup. It acts as the game server where you install and run your games. The Nestri Node streams gameplay from the machine it’s installed on, allowing you to access your games remotely. It runs on most Linux-based systems and requires an NVIDIA graphics card to ensure a high-quality gaming experience.

Since Nestri Node cannot run alongside Xorg (the graphical interface), it’s recommended to install it on a dedicated machine. This way, your server can focus solely on streaming your games while avoiding conflicts with your local display setup.

### Nestri Relay
The Nestri Relay is responsible for transporting the video stream from your Nestri Node to the device you're gaming on. By default, Nestri connects to the Nestri-hosted Relay, which requires no configuration and is available for all users. This simplifies the setup process, ensuring a smooth streaming experience without the need for advanced networking or SSL certificate management.

For advanced users, it's possible to self-host the relay, but this requires the setup of secure SSL certificates. This option is typically more complex and is recommended only for developers or those familiar with network configuration.
