## Is Nestri free?  
Yes! Nestri offers three options: a free, self-hosted version, a free and paid **Bring Your Own GPU (BYOG)** version, and a paid, hosted version.  

- **Self-Hosted Version (Free):**  
  If you have your own server, you can install and run Nestri for free. Since Nestri is open-source, you have full access to the codebase, allowing for transparency and flexibility in your setup.  

- **Bring Your Own GPU (BYOG):**  
  With BYOG, you can use your own server with a GPU to play your games while avoiding the hassle of setting up relays, web interfaces, port forwarding, and other technical configurations. BYOG is available in both a free and a paid package:  
  - The **Free BYOG package** lets you get started with basic functionality.  
  - The **Paid BYOG package** unlocks exclusive features only available in BYOG and Hosted versions.

- **[Hosted Version (Paid)](https://nestri.io/pricing):**  
  The hosted version of Nestri operates similarly to services like NVIDIA GeForce Now. With a subscription, you can play your games on Nestri’s infrastructure without needing any technical knowledge—just sign up, log in, and start gaming!  


## Does Nestri require a high-speed internet connection?
Yes, a stable and fast internet connection is essential for a smooth gaming experience. While you don’t need extremely high speeds (like 1 Gbps fiber), low latency is critical. Since cloud gaming is sensitive to delay, your device needs to connect to one of our relays with minimal lag. Ensuring a strong, stable network connection close to a relay server is important to avoid delays in gameplay, especially during fast-paced action sequences.

## Where are Nestri’s relays located?
Currently, we have one relay deployed in Helsinki, Finland. As we grow, we plan to add more relays to reduce latency and improve connection quality for users in different regions. Our next planned relay is in Copenhagen, Denmark. Since we’re a startup with a limited budget, we’ll continue to roll out more relays as demand grows and more users join the platform.

## Is Nestri like Parsec?
No, Nestri is not like Parsec, which is used to access and game on an existing desktop remotely. Nestri is a server application designed specifically for cloud gaming. Rather than connecting to a physical Windows desktop, Nestri runs your games within a Docker or Podman container, allowing you to play remotely without needing to access a traditional desktop environment.

## Do I need a high-end server with a 4090 GPU and a 64-core CPU?
Not necessarily! Nestri doesn’t have strict hardware requirements in terms of having the latest or most powerful CPU or GPU. Just as with traditional gaming, better hardware will enhance your experience with improved graphics and higher FPS. The exact specs you need will depend on the games you want to play and the performance you’re aiming for. Keep in mind that, because Nestri runs games on Linux using Proton and the Gstreamer encoding, there will be a bit of additional processing required, so some extra power will be helpful.

## Do you have an app for phone or TV?  
Not yet! At the moment, we don’t have a dedicated app. However, since the Nestri interface works on most devices with a Chromium-based browser, you can play your games that way on your phone, TV, or other devices.  

We’re actively working on developing an app that will make it even easier to play your games on mobile, your TV, or install a client directly on your PC. Stay tuned for updates!

## Do I need to port forward to use Nestri?  
No! If you’re using Nestri BYOG, you won’t need to port forward anything on your router or firewall.  

Since Nestri is based on WebRTC, the Nestri node connects directly with the client via our relays. All you need to do is install Nestri on your server and start your game through our web interface—no complicated networking setup required! 

## What games can I play on Nestri?  
Currently, Nestri only supports Steam games that are compatible with Proton, as Nestri is Linux-based.  

When you launch Nestri, you’ll have access to Steam Big Picture mode, just like on your PC. You can check which games are supported by Proton and their ratings on [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/).  

This ensures a smooth gaming experience for a wide range of titles, and we’re continually working to expand compatibility!  

## Do I need my own server?  
No! We also offer a **[Hosted version](https://nestri.io/pricing)**, where you can use our infrastructure. All you need to do is start your game through our interface, and we’ll handle the rest.  

If you don’t have your own physical server, you can also run Nestri in the cloud. Simply use a dedicated server with a GPU or platforms like AWS, Digital Ocean, or similar services that offer GPU solutions.  

Whether you prefer using your own setup or a hassle-free hosted solution, Nestri has you covered!
