**Nestri Node** is the core component of Nestri's self-hosted cloud-gaming solution. It is the actual server where you install your games. Once set up, you can stream and play your games remotely from any compatible device. It runs on most Linux-based systems and requires a NVIDIA, AMD or Intel graphics card.
