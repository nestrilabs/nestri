# Prerequisite

In order to run Nestri on your own server, there are a few things you need to prepare before you can start installing nestri-node. On this page we go through the requirements needed to get started with Nestri.

Although it may be very tempting to skip this step, you shouldn't! You will save yourself a lot of headaches and wasted hours because something doesn't work due to lack of setup beforehand.

## Hardware Requirements

::list{type="primary"}
- **NVIDIA GPU**
- **8GB Memory**
- **Linux** (We Recommend Ubuntu Desktop 22.04)
::

## Software Requirements

::list{type="primary"}
- **Nvidia Drivers**
- **[NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html#installing-with-apt)**
- **[Docker](https://linuxiac.com/how-to-install-docker-on-ubuntu-24-04-lts/)**

## Disconnect monitor
Since Nestri requires access to your GPU, then you need to unplug you screen from it.
If you want to see the Desktop and have a integrated graphicscard in your CPU, then you can connect your monitor to the motherboard.
### Change the Default Boot Target to Multi-User (Non-GUI Mode)
Ubuntu typically starts in graphical mode (using the graphical.target systemd target). You should change to the non-graphical multi-user.target, which will prevent Xorg from starting.

1. Open a terminal or access your system via SSH.
2. To check your current default target (which should be graphical.target)

```bash
systemctl get-default

```

3. Change the default target to multi-user.target (which corresponds to text mode, without Xorg):
```bash
sudo systemctl set-default multi-user.target


```

4. Reboot the system

5. Verify that Xorg is not running
```bash
nvidia-smi
```
