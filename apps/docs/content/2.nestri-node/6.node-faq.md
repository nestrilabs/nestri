## Can I run Nestri Node on Debian/Ubuntu?
Yes, this is now possible

## Can I run Nestri Node in a virtualized environment like Proxmox?
Yes, you can run Nestri Node in a virtualized environment, provided you passthrough your GPU to the virtual machine. However, we do not recommend this setup as virtualization may introduce additional overhead and latency. For the best performance, we recommend running Nestri Node on bare-metal hardware.

## Can I run Nestri Node on Windows-based systems?
No, the Nestri Node service does not support Windows-based systems. It can only be deployed on Linux servers.
