### Construct The Nestri Runner Docker Image
Checkout your branch with the latest version of nestri and build the image `<your-nestri-image>` within git root folder:
```bash [build docker image command]
docker buildx build -t <your-nestri-image>:latest -f Containerfile.runner .
```

### Running other applications besides Steam
When you followed the getting started guide, you already have a container running. You can get into your container to start your games or other applications:
```bash [get into container command]
sudo docker exec -it nestri bash
```

For most games that are not DRM free you need a launcher. In this case use the umu launcher and optional mangohud:
```bash [install umu and mangohud command]
pacman -S --overwrite="*" umu-launcher mangohud
```

You have to execute your game now with nestri user. If you have a linux game just execute it with the nestri user
```bash [execute game command]
su nestri
source /etc/nestri/envs.sh
GAMEID=0 PROTONPATH=GE-Proton mangohud umu-run /mnt/game/<your-game.exe>
```

You could also use other launchers like Lutris to run other games.
